## Mechanism

Epinephrine works by binding to a and ß adrenergic receptors causing a stimulant response.

The most prominent actions are on the beta receptors of the heart, vascular and other smooth muscle.

Epinephrine relaxes the smooth muscles of the bronchi and is a physiologic antagonist of histamine, therefore reversing Histamine's effects, 20% a and 80%

Rapid IV injection produces a rapid rise in blood pressure, mainly systolic by direct stimulation of the cardiac müscle which increases the ventricular contraction. (ALS only)

Increased systemic vascular resistance

- Chronotropic effeacts i c a l
  +Inotropic
  +Dromotropic effects, stociates

- Onset in 3 - 10 min SQ/IM
