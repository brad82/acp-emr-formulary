## Mechanism

Epinephrine works by binding to a and ß adrenergic receptors causing a stimulant response.

The most prominent actions are on the beta receptors of the heart, vascular and other smooth muscle.

Epinephrine relaxes the smooth muscles of the bronchi and is a physiologic antagonist of histamine, therefore reversing Histamine's effects, 20% a and 80%.

Rapid IV injection produces a rapid rise in blood pressure, mainly systolic by direct stimulation of the cardiac müscle which increases the ventricular contraction. (ALS only).

Increased systemic vascular resistance\
\+ Chronotropic effects\
\+ Inotropic effects\
\+ Dromotropic effects

- Onset in 3 - 10 min SQ/IM
- Peak effects within 20 min SQ/IM
- Duration of 20 - 30 min SQ/IM
- ½ life of 3- 5 min depending on rate of vasoconstriction which could delay the absorption rate
