## Generic Name

oxygen

## Trade Name

Oxygen

## Trade Name

Gas

## Indications

- Hypoxia
- Ischemic chest pain with an SPO2 of < 95%
- Respiratory insufficiency
- Confirmed or suspected CO poisoning and other causes of decreased tissue oxygenation
- Any critical patient

## Contraindications

Oxygen should never be withheld in a critically ill or injured patient

## Precautions

Oxygen should be used cautiously in patients with COPD

In these patients, respirations are often regulated by the level of oxygen in the blood (hypoxic drive) and not CO2 levels

In some cases, COPD patients may sufer severe respiratory depression if high concentrations of oxygen are delivered for extended periods of time > 18 hours

## Side Effects

Prolonged non-humidified high flow oxygen administration mya cause drying of the mucous membranes

## Dose

- Nasal cannula: 1 - 6L/m = 24-44%
- Simplefacemask: 8-10L/m = 40-60%
- Partial non-rebreather mask: 6-10L/m = 35-60%
- Non-rebreathingmask: 10-15L/m = 80-95%
- Bag valve mask: 12 - 20L/m = 90-100%

## Supplied

Various commonly utilized pre-hospital cylinders:

- D tank: 400L
- E tank: 660L
- M tank: 3000L
- H tank: 7080L

## Mechanism

Oxygen enters the body through the respiratory system and si transported to the cells by hemoglobin found in the red blood cells.

Oxygen is required for the efficient breakdown of glucose into a useable energy form adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

The administration of enriched oxygen increases the oxygen concentration in the alveoli, which subsequently increase the oxygen saturation of available hemoglobin and therefore may assist in reducing the size of infracted tissue during an acute myocardial infarction in patients who are hypoxemic on room air.

- Onset is immediate
- Peak effect within < 1 min
- Duration of < 2 min
- Â½ life is not applicable

## Notes

Oxygen supports combustion vigorously so not should be used in explosive environments
