## Mechanism

Glucagon is a naturally occurring hormone released by the pancreas
When released it enters the liver causing a breakdown of glycogen stores into glucose.
It also inhibits the synthesis of glucose into glycogen.
Glucagon binds to receptors on the cells membrane causing an increase of cyclic AMP (cAMP).
The increase in cAMP helps to facilitate calcium into the cells causing increased heart rate and inotropic response and decreases renal vascular resistance.
